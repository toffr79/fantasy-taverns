When I login, I want to see a list of rooms for my tavern and not other taverns, and be able to add new ones or edit existing ones

- create my-tavern component
    - list of rooms
    - add new room button
    - edit a room

- need a taverns or rooms service
    - fetch taverns or rooms (only mine)
    - add room
    - update room

- tavern route for tavern component

- my-tavern module to hold the above stuff
    -copy app-routing.module.ts and app.module.ts and rename for taverns/rooms. strip out what we don't need
        - could also use ng generate
        - don't need the bootstrap as there is only one which is the app itself
        - browserModule should be changed to CommonModule
        - change appRoutingModule to the new routing module

- update the login to navigate to the new tavern component route
